    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Daja is an open source D compiler developed as a personal project by me, Peter C.
      Chapin. I created Daja primarily to support the compiler design course at Vermont
      Technical College, and thus it is intended to be an educational compiler. However, it is
      also my hope that Daja may eventually provide another option for those interested in using
      an open source D compiler. Although the existing D compilers are all fine products, I
      believe in the value of diversity when it comes to available programming tools.</para>

    <para>Daja is written primarily in the Scala programming language. I chose Scala because it
      is a functional language, and thus supports features that I believe will be helpful for
      compiler construction (such as algebraic data types and pattern matching). Also the use of
      Scala fits well into the context of my compiler design course. Accordingly, it is my
      intention to write Daja in as purely a functional style as feasible with the hope that
      doing so will make the code more understandable, more reliable, and more amenable to
      parallelization. In addition, Scala gives me access to an enormous collection of Java
      libraries, tools, and technologies, many of which are very powerful and highly mature. I
      intend to capitalize on that legacy as much as possible during the development of
      Daja.</para>

    <para>I understand that Scala is an unusual choice as an implementation language for a D
      compiler. I understand that I would be more likely to attract help from the D community if
      I wrote Daja in D. However, as a personal project I have the luxury of selecting tools
      that interest me even if they might not be strategically optimal. I hope my choice of
      Scala pays off in the long run. If the compiler is easier to write or if Daja eventually
      becomes a bridge between the Scala/Java and D communities, my choice might prove to be
      strategic after all.</para>

    <para>Daja is intended to target the LLVM compiler framework. This allows me to defer the
      details of low level code generation and optimization to the framework. Thus in theory
      Daja supports all target architectures supported by LLVM, both now and in the future. This
      approach also allows me to capitalize on future advances made in LLVM technology. However,
      unlike high level virtual machines such as the JVM or the CLR, LLVM should not restrict my
      implementation options. I believe it will be easier to accurately implement a language
      like D, which is intended to support low level programming, on top of a low level
      framework.</para>

    <para>However, as a concession to educational practicalities, Daja currently has multiple
      code generating modes that include the generation of C or JVM assembly language. It also
      supports an interpretive mode. It is likely that support for some or all of these
      additional modes will be dropped as Daja matures since developing and maintaining multiple
      code generators adds considerably to the work involved in building Daja.</para>

    <para>I anticipate that as Daja matures others will become attracted to the project and may
      join the effort. For this reason, along with the fact that many of my students have
      contributed to this project, aside from this introduction, the documentation is written as
      if it is being authored by a group of contributors rather than just a single
      person.</para>

    <para>This documentation describes both the design and use of the Daja compiler.</para>
