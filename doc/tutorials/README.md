Tutorials
=========

This folder contains two tutorials. One on Scala for D programmers (D2Scala) and the other on D
for Scala programmers (Scala2D). Since Daja might be of interest to programmers from both
communities it seemed like a good idea to provide tutorials that would be relevant to both
communities. For example a D person who wants to contribute to Daja might need to learn Scala.
In contrast a Scala person who wants to contribute might need to learn D.

The tutorials here assume reasonable fluency in the "source" language and focus on the
techniques and technologies used by Daja. However they are intended to be reasonably general and
could be of interest to a wider audience as well. Furthermore a reader does not have to know the
exact source language of each tutorial to benefit from them. For example a reader fluent with
C++ but not D could still read the D2Scala tutorial to learn the basics of Scala. The D code in
that tutorial will probably be readable enough and the general orientation of the document
should be compatible with a C++ programmer's world view. Similarly a Java programmer interested
in learning D could benefit from the Scala2D tutorial as well.

The tutorials are written in DocBook v5. They should be readable in a text editor but a DocBook
tool chain would be necessary to generate HTML or PDF from the tutorial source.
